#
# [ POLICY ]
#
# Drupal is a complex application that is hard to secure with the CRS. This set
# of exclusion rules aims to sanitise the CRS in a way that allows a default
# Drupal setup to be installed and configured without much hassle as far as
# ModSecurity and the CRS are concerned.
#
# The exclusion rules are fairly straight forward in the sense that they
# disable CRS on a set of well-known parameter fields that are often the source
# of false positives / false alarms of the CRS. This includes namely the
# session cookie, the password fields and article/node bodies.
#
# This is based on two assumptions: - You have a basic trust in your
# authenticated users who are allowed to edit nodes.  - Drupal allows html
# content in nodes and it protects your users from attacks via these fields.
#
# If you think these assumptions are wrong or if you would prefer a more
# careful/secure approach, you can disable the exclusion rules handling of said
# node body false positives. Do this by placing the following directive in
# RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS.conf.
#
# SecRuleRemoveById 9506200-9506299
#
# This will mean the CRS remain intact for the editing of node bodies.
#
# The exclusion rules in this file work without the need to define a Drupal
# installation path prefix. Instead they look at the URI from the end - or
# they use regular expressions when targeting dynamic URL. This is all not
# totally foolproof. In some cases, an advanced attacker might be able to
# doctor a request in a way that one of these exclusion rules is triggered
# and the request will bypass all further inspection despite not being a
# Drupal request at all. These exclusion rules could thus be leveraged to
# disable the CRS completely. This is why these rules are off by default.
#
# The CRS rules covered by this ruleset are the rules with Paranoia Level 1 and
# 2. If you chose to run Paranoia Level 3 or 4, you will be facing additional
# false positives which you need to handle yourself.
#
# This set of exclusion rules does not cover any additional Drupal modules
# outside of core.
#
# The exclusion rules are based on Drupal 8.1.10.
#
# And finally: This set of exclusion rules is in an experimental state. If you
# encounter false positives with the basic Drupal functionality and they are
# not covered by this rule file, then please report them. The aim is to be able
# to install and run Drupal core in a seamless manner protected by
# ModSecurity / CRS up to the paranoia level 2.

# [ Session Cookie ]
#
# Giving the session cookie a dynamic name is most unfortunate
# from a ModSecurity perspective. The rule language does not allow
# us to disable rules in a granular way for individual cookies with
# dynamic names. So we need to disable rule causing false positives
# for all cookies and their names.
